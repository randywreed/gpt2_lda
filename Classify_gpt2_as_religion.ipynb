       "  xxmaj the xxmaj talmud notes that the xxmaj hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word \" xxmaj torah \" is 611 , and combining xxmaj moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the xxmaj ten xxmaj commandments which were the only ones heard directly from xxmaj god , adds up to 613 . xxmaj the xxmaj talmud attributes the number 613 to xxmaj rabbi xxmaj xxunk , but other classical sages who hold this view include xxmaj rabbi xxmaj simeon ben xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj rabbi xxmaj eleazar ben xxmaj xxunk the xxmaj galilean . xxmaj it is quoted in xxmaj midrash xxmaj xxunk xxmaj rabbah xxunk , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj rabbah xxunk ; xxunk and xxmaj talmud xxmaj xxunk xxunk . \n",

       "  xxmaj this bound future descendants of the xxmaj afrikaner to commemorate the day as a religious holiday ( sabbath ) in the case of victory over the xxmaj xxunk by promising to build a church in xxmaj god 's honour . xxmaj by xxmaj july 1839 nothing had yet been done at xxmaj xxunk regarding their pledge to build a church , and it was xxmaj jan xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk himself who motivated everyone to keep that promise . xxmaj in 1841 with capital accumulated by xxmaj xxunk at the xxmaj xxunk , the xxmaj church of the xxmaj vow at xxmaj xxunk was eventually built - the biggest donor being the widow , xxmaj mrs. xxunk xxmaj xxunk in xxmaj xxunk . \n",
       "  xxmaj as the original vow was never recorded in verbatim form , descriptions come only from the diary of xxmaj jan xxmaj xxunk with a dispatch written by xxmaj xxunk xxmaj pretorius to the xxmaj xxunk on 23 xxmaj december 1838 ; and the recollections of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk in 1871 . a participant in the battle , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj pretorius also wrote his recollections in 1862 , interpreting the vow as including the building of churches and schools ( xxmaj bailey xxunk ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj jan xxup b. xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk ) , xxmaj pretorius ' secretary , indicates that the initial promise was to build a xxmaj house in return for victory . xxmaj he notes that xxmaj pretorius called everyone together in his tent , ( the senior officers ) and asked them to pray for xxmaj god 's help . xxmaj xxunk writes in his journal that xxmaj pretorius told the assembly that he wanted to make a vow , \" if everyone would agree \" ( xxmaj bailey xxunk ) . xxmaj xxunk does not say whether everyone did so . xxmaj perhaps the fractious nature of the xxmaj xxunk dictated that the raiding party held their own prayers in the tents of various leading men ( xxmaj mackenzie xxunk ) . xxmaj pretorius is also quoted as wanting to have a book written to make known what xxmaj god had done to even \" our last xxunk . xxmaj pretorius in his 1838 dispatch mentions a vow ( xxmaj afrikaans : xxunk ) in connection with the building of a church , but not that it would be binding for future generations . \n",

       "  we here have decided among ourselves ... to make known the day of our victory ... among the whole of our generation , and that we want to devote it to xxmaj god , and to celebrate [ it ] with thanksgiving , just as we ... promised [ xxunk ] in public prayer \n",
       "  xxmaj contrary to xxmaj pretorius , and in agreement with xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj xxunk in 1870 recalled a promise ( xxmaj afrikaans : xxunk ) , not a vow , to commemorate the day and to tell the story to future generations . xxmaj accordingly , they would remember : \n",

       "  the day and date , every year as a commemoration and a day of thanksgiving , as though a xxmaj sabbath ... and that we will also tell it to our children , that they should share in it with us , for the remembrance of our future generations \n",
       "  xxmaj xxunk writes that those who objected were given the option to leave . xxmaj at least two persons declined to participate in the vow . xxmaj scholars disagree about whether the accompanying xxmaj english settlers and servants complied ( xxmaj bailey 2003 ) . xxmaj this seems to confirm that the promise was binding only on those present at the actual battle . xxmaj mackenzie ( 1997 ) claims that xxmaj xxunk may be recalling what he said to men who met in his tent . \n",
       "  xxmaj up to the 1970s the received version of events was seldom questioned , but since then scholars have questioned almost every aspect . xxmaj they debate whether a vow was even taken and , if so , what its wording was . xxmaj some argue that the vow occurred on the day of the battle , others point to 7 or 9 xxmaj december . xxmaj whether xxmaj xxunk xxmaj pretorius or xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk led the assembly has been debated ; and even whether there was an assembly . xxmaj the location at which the vow was taken has also produced diverging opinions , with some rejecting the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj river site for ( xxmaj bailey 2003 ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj in the weeks before xxmaj passover , matzos are prepared for holiday consumption . xxmaj in many xxmaj orthodox xxmaj jewish communities , men traditionally gather in groups ( \" xxunk \" ) to bake handmade matzo for use at the xxmaj seder , the dough being rolled by hand , resulting in a large and round matzo . xxmaj xxunk also work together in machine - made matzo factories , which produce the typically square - shaped matzo sold in stores . \n",
       "  xxmaj the baking of matzo is labor - intensive , as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven . xxmaj consequently , only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time , and the xxunk members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise . a special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the xxunk puff up ; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo . \n",
       "  xxmaj after the matzos come out of the oven , the entire work area is xxunk down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old , potentially leavened dough remain , as any stray pieces are now chametz , and can contaminate the next batch of matzo . \n",

       "  xxmaj the xxmaj talmud notes that the xxmaj hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word \" xxmaj torah \" is 611 , and combining xxmaj moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the xxmaj ten xxmaj commandments which were the only ones heard directly from xxmaj god , adds up to 613 . xxmaj the xxmaj talmud attributes the number 613 to xxmaj rabbi xxmaj xxunk , but other classical sages who hold this view include xxmaj rabbi xxmaj simeon ben xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj rabbi xxmaj eleazar ben xxmaj xxunk the xxmaj galilean . xxmaj it is quoted in xxmaj midrash xxmaj xxunk xxmaj rabbah xxunk , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj rabbah xxunk ; xxunk and xxmaj talmud xxmaj xxunk xxunk . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj rabbi xxmaj abraham ibn xxmaj ezra denied that this was an authentic rabbinic tradition . xxmaj ibn xxmaj ezra writes \" xxmaj some sages xxunk 613 mitzvot in many diverse ways [ ... ] but in truth there is no end to the number of mitzvot [ ... ] and if we were to count only the root principles [ ... ] the number of mitzvot would not reach xxunk . xxmaj nahmanides held that this particular counting was a matter of rabbinic controversy , and that rabbinic opinion on this is not unanimous . xxmaj nonetheless , he concedes that \" this total has proliferated throughout the aggadic literature ... we ought to say that it was a tradition from xxmaj moses at xxmaj mount xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj rabbi xxmaj simeon ben xxmaj xxunk xxmaj duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the xxmaj law , saying that \" perhaps the agreement that the number of mitzvot is 613 ... is just xxmaj rabbi xxmaj xxunk 's opinion , following his own xxunk of the mitzvot . xxmaj and we need not rely on his xxunk when we come to determine [ and affect ] the xxmaj law , but rather on the xxmaj talmudic xxunk . xxmaj gersonides held that the number 613 was only one rabbi 's ( xxmaj rabbi xxmaj xxunk 's ) opinion , and if the conclusion of a xxmaj talmudic discussion indicated that the number of commandments was greater or lesser than 613 , xxmaj rabbi xxmaj xxunk 's opinion would be overruled . \n",
       "  xxmaj the xxmaj vilna xxmaj gaon suggested that there exist many more than 613 commandments ( because otherwise large narrative parts of the xxmaj pentateuch would be without commandments , which he considered difficult to accept ) and that the count of 613 refers to \" roots \" ( xxunk ) of the other commandments . xxmaj even when rabbis attempted to compile a list of the 613 commandments , they were faced with a number of difficulties : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj which statements were to be included amongst the 613 commandments ? xxmaj every one of xxmaj god 's commands to any individual or to the entire people of xxmaj israel ? \n",

( xxmaj the latter is the view of xxmaj maimonides . ) \n",
       "  xxmaj does counting a single commandment depend on whether it falls within one verse , even though it may contain multiple prohibitions , or should each prohibition count as a single xxunk , though , the concept of 613 commandments has become accepted as normative amongst practicing xxmaj jews and today it is still common practice to refer to the total system of commandments within the xxmaj torah as the \" 613 commandments \" , even among those who do not literally accept this count as accurate . xxmaj however , the 613 mitzvot do not constitute a formal code of present - day halakha . xxmaj later codes of law such as the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj arukh and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj arukh do not refer to it . xxmaj however , xxmaj maimonides ' xxmaj mishneh xxmaj torah is prefaced by a count of the 613 mitzvot . \n",
