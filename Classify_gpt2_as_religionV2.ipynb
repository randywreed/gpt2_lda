              "  xxmaj abraham 's name is apparently very ancient , as the tradition found in xxmaj genesis no longer understands its original meaning ( probably \" xxmaj father is exalted \" – the meaning offered in xxmaj genesis xxunk , \" xxmaj father of a multitude \" , is a popular etymology ) . xxmaj the story , like those of the other patriarchs , most likely had a substantial oral prehistory . xxmaj at some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the xxmaj pentateuch ; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the xxmaj persian period , roughly xxunk xxup bce . xxmaj the mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown , but there are currently two important hypotheses . xxmaj the first , called xxmaj persian xxmaj imperial authorisation , is that the post - xxmaj exilic community devised the xxmaj torah as a legal basis on which to function within the xxmaj persian xxmaj imperial system ; the second is that the xxmaj pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for determining who would belong to the post xxmaj exilic xxmaj jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups , notably the priesthood and the lay \" xxunk . xxmaj nevertheless , the completion of the xxmaj torah and its elevation to the centre of post - xxmaj exilic xxmaj judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final xxmaj pentateuch was based on existing traditions . xxmaj in xxmaj ezekiel xxunk , written during the xxmaj exile ( i.e. , in the first half of the 6th century xxup bce ) , xxmaj ezekiel , an exile in xxmaj babylon , tells how those who remained in xxmaj judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from xxmaj abraham ; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe xxmaj torah . xxmaj isaiah xxunk similarly testifies of tension between the people of xxmaj judah and the returning post - xxmaj exilic xxmaj jews ( the \" xxunk \" ) , stating that xxmaj god is the father of xxmaj israel and that xxmaj israel 's history begins with the xxmaj exodus and not with xxmaj abraham . xxmaj the conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence ( e.g. , xxmaj ezra – xxmaj nehemiah ) , is that the figure of xxmaj abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of xxmaj judah at the time of the xxmaj exile and after , serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles . \n",
