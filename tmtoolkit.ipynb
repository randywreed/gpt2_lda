If this happens the implications for religion are potentially immense – maybe there\\'s no real point to believing in any gods at present anyway?\\nA few years ago I met with two young scientists who were working on creating intelligent machines (they call them \"superintelligences\") by mimicking our own cognitive processes: they didn\\'t have access yet even though their research was just getting started… They showed me some of these superintelligence systems running around or sitting behind glass displays somewhere! This caused quite significant concern among my atheist friends because we know from neuroscience how humans can get hooked into certain patterns when watching movies like Avatar, but what if such things happened inside computers instead?! In fact it seems likely many people could become convinced about AI without ever having seen one personally. Now imagine being confronted not only once before you die against your will through science fiction films; now think back another time after death where religious beliefs still play important roles…. What do atheists need more than anything else right then!?\\xa0\\n\\nSo here comes Dr Novella again talking nonsense... He thinks he has discovered evidence which shows \\'god\\' exists - although obviously nothing suggests otherwise either way!! For example his idea would imply human beings create god out-of thin air so why don\\'t aliens also exist??? Actually Dawkins himself says much better examples suggest creationism rather Gods existence! Also remember Einstein said whatever created us did NOT use magic technology.... But since most religions say everything must come directly form/be produced via supernatural power Why does Christianity believe Jesus rose bodily up onto earth AFTER dying????? And look.. its really hard work trying keep track down contradictions between different versions thereof itself :) Just ignore those idiots claiming Christians invented evolution!!! __________________'], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God.

If this happens the implications for religion are profound because it would mean there's no reason to believe in anything supernatural any more; if we're not talking about miracles or divine intervention then what could possibly exist?\\nThe only way around these objections from atheists of course being 'but but'! It doesn't follow therefore some other entity must have created us – which can never happen (unless by accident) so atheism has always been wrong again… right?! Wrong on both counts really: according one interpretation our lives began with nothing at least after three days without even water etc.; another interprets them started when Adam was made man while still living inside Eve until he fell unconscious later leaving her pregnant like Moses did too … So I guess where you come down depends upon whether your belief system says life came into existence before 3-days worth just happened out thereof/in hindsight i think most people do say yes thus they don't agree either... however perhaps their position needs revision since apparently neither creationists nor evolutionist accept such claims.. As far back history goes many cultures believed gods were real entities beyond human comprehension — notably those who lived thousands years ago also had Gods among themselves -so why should ours?? My point here though isn't necessarily meant negatively towards Christianity itself…. although admittedly religious beliefs aren't exactly conducive toward rational thinking & understanding often lead believers astray quite easily sometimes making mistakes due simply ignorance / lack knowledge :)\"], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God. If this happens the implications for religion are', \"If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God. If this happens the implications for religion are obvious – we would need to find another word or definition of 'God' because it was impossible not only in what science could tell us about ourselves but also by our experience with other beings (including those who don't believe) such creatures can have different beliefs than humans do!\\nOne important consequence seems likely: if there were intelligent alien lifeforms they may well take Christianity literally whereas most non-believers seem more inclined towards metaphysics rather then theology which means Christians will still hold their views on salvation/atonement very much like atheists despite some Christian theologians now claiming otherwise. In fact one way you'd expect them even before aliens show up maybe give Jesus back his name? We already know how these people behave when confronted at conferences without any evidence contrary theories so perhaps no new revelations await me just yet.. The world's greatest minds including Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking et al suggest religions should focus less upon belief(s), practice & worship instead focusing largely around love from within ones heart...

We know robots do exist today too … So far nothing has happened yet except scientists building smaller versions using current components available everywhere nowadays.. And yes computer hackers love creating superintelligent bots anyway : ) What about religious believers? This one becomes pretty interesting really fast actually…. When discussing godhood \"theism\" typically comes under attack right off since atheists tend make assumptions based upon belief systems rather certain observable facts (\"God exists\") whereas Christian theology doesn\\'t always come across well simply given lack evidence behind claims regarding deity creation stories — especially ones claiming Jesus didn\\'t die until after his resurrection according Biblical scholars\\' understanding! As much logic goes back around these topics each side will argue against Christianity regardless whether those assertions contain truth whatsoever thus making debate very pointless IMO 😉 However still our society tends towards superstition & mythology often leading ourselves astray whenever presented situations arise wherein supernatural beings may appear overconfident thinking themselves invincible unless proven otherwise i guess…….... On top note however having intelligent machines compete directly amongst humanity presents new opportunities beyond merely competing militarily…..

What about other aspects of human life like morality or ethics - do they require divine intervention in some way too (just ask Hitler).\\nThe problem with such thinking was clear enough when I first encountered it; but now things have changed dramatically since then so let\\'s see if there still remains room here... In fact these kinds arguments were already very well known even before Einstein published his famous work on general relativity which has been used by many atheists themselves against religious believers who claim evolution did not happen! The idea itself stems from Newtonian mechanics, where space-time behaves differently depending upon whether you\\'re inside Earth orbit around Sun/star at its centre...or travelling through time between past & future locations within Universe. It doesn\\'t matter though because physics isn\\'t concerned directly anymore than astronomy nor philosophy regarding reality....and just think why don\\'t scientists tend towards atheism any more? Why does science take care over every detail concerning physical universe instead choosing only one particular hypothesis / theory outta hundreds available?? And yes i\\'m talking specifically astrophysics : nobody believes quantum gravity model right away..it takes decades until people realise \"wow look no longer classical world after years ago\". Science always works best once our basic understanding gets fixed properly into place ; otherwise everything seems completely random again! So anyway back topic my point being..why should anyone feel threatened seeing scientific ideas based solely offof mathematics making their debut nowadays while previously those same mathematical theories could easily lead us astray without realising?! Surely anybody reading me will agree \\xa0that math cannot possibly predict anything whatsoever?? :) That would make perfect sense indeed except mathematicians today use complex formulas derived largely via brute force calculations rather using sophisticated concepts applied explicitly down below…however mathematically precise ones may sound relatively speaking dueto complexity alone!! One thing however keeps coming up whenever someone tries saying maths aren\\'t accurate beyond certain limits yet also claiming nonphysical explanations need them....is obviously lackadaised amounts o f error factors inherent along side numerical values resulting sometimes almost incomparably higher accuracy level compared wether exact result computed numerically vs calculated manually versus approximations achieved thru computationally inexact methods performed independently btw …in practice calculation errors generally increase exponentially during processing stage leading eventually getting extremely close results usually slightly worse later end ups showin'], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God.

The way these forms form isn\\'t random either since scientists found several ways around naturalistic explanations like radioactive decay being involved which makes perfect sense considering how such processes naturally occur… When talking among friends during discussion groups discussing evolution theory our conversation tends towards asking each other questions along those lines even down into detail (\"Where did life comefrom?\") And while most atheists will tell me eventually \\'there goes faith\\' after awhile... But let us look closer.. Evolutionary theories explain exactly HOW organisms evolve through various mechanisms including mutation, migration etc., yet many fundamentalist Christians simply refuse ALL biological phenomena involving Darwinian principles saying \"…this would never ever really prove ANYTHING!\" Yes indeedy once again claiming only empirical data gives credence & validity too much importance within Christianity itself!! It seems obvious now given past experiences amongst myself personally having gone so long ignoring scientific knowledge concerning evolutionary thought methods then surely others ought realize same thing! So backtracking further onto nuclear fission specifically i am reminded daily watching shows showing kids building machines making toys doing drills drilling holes digging tools cutting metal laying wires connecting parts together..etc…..It almost seemed silly seeing children get excited every morning before school starting off day learning math until suddenly he realized hey maybe biology wasn\\'t quite dead enough already 😉 Once more regarding Creationist statements……You see certain aspects usually include comparing everything manmade somehow apart humans ie fossils vs plants : What?! They don\\'t know dinosaurs lived millions years ago??? Or earth existed billions OF YEARS AGO?? Are THEY seriously trying compare god(s), ancient gods / angels et al alongside human beings themselves???? Such concepts seem ludicrously naive despite seeming logical otherwise today compared 1 million plus year old history books depicting Ancient Egyptians literally worshipping pharaoh Amenemhat III right next door whilst simultaneously living hundreds thousands miles away across sea running ocean currents covering vast distances looking upwards above mountains built millennia earlier.......We\\'ve seen entire civilizations rise& fall due largely outside Gods control whereas modern Egypt could easily remain standing following relatively recent events affecting its political economy....So basically anyone believing Biblical stories shouldn\\'t honestly claim ignorance whatsoever anyway? Now consider another aspect common throughout Christian arguments….How quickly mankind supposedly progressed.....Is Earth currently experiencing global warming caused solely attributed unto climate change occurring recently????? We\\'re still 3 billion+years older planet hasn\\'t advanced THAT MUCH beyond 6000 BC!! Of course yes Genesis tells humanity Adam came 2nd generation species meaning his descendants aren\\'t supposed t o walk upright according eithne generations hence apparently couldn\\'t possibly comprehend complex mathematics till ~6000BC although current evidences show clearly technology evolved considerably faster especially via astronomy aka telescope......Yet amazingly Bible writers continue pushing forward ideas proving humankind started developing space travel sometime between 10 000 BCE TO 4000 AD however ultimately didn\\'t develop technologies capable converting heat energy stored inside bodies thru solar radiation heating air masses directly prior 7000 BP depending entirely whether Sunspot activity occurred therefore influencing weather conditions particularly storm dynamics perhaps leading later periods witnessing rapid technological advancement allowing early astronauts explore outer planets Saturn Jupiter Uranus Neptune Pluto moon discoveries revealing giant oceans full moons appearing 40000 Bp historical records reveal Mars likely inhabited 8000yrs bc roughly 1000x times less explored area relative size difference??

If this happens the implications for religion are very different than if we were to assume it was not omnipotent or omniscient at first glance (a mistake often made by people who do NOT believe in intelligent design).\\nThis does have some serious consequences though – you can no longer rely on any kind of religious system based upon supernatural agency alone; because anything with divine power must also represent both real world evidence/evidence-based reasons why their claims hold up AND they cannot just make things happen out there without presenting compelling reason behind them!\\xa0 This means when someone says \"God created my universe\" instead your response should actually say: _______________________________________________ How about using science? \\xa0 I\\'ll give examples below but here\\'s one simple example from physics where creationism doesn\\'t work well against what has been scientifically proven thus far - atomic nuclei spontaneously forming over time. The way these forms form isn\\'t random either since scientists found several ways around naturalistic explanations like radioactive decay being involved which makes perfect sense considering how such processes naturally occur… When talking among friends during discussion groups discussing evolution theory our conversation tends towards asking each other questions along those lines even down into detail (\"Where did life comefrom?\") And while most atheists will tell me eventually \\'there goes faith\\' after awhile... But let us look closer.. Evolutionary theories explain exactly HOW organisms evolve through various mechanisms including mutation, migration etc., yet many fundamentalist Christians simply refuse ALL biological phenomena involving Darwinian principles saying \"…this would never ever really prove ANYTHING!\" Yes indeedy once again claiming only empirical data gives credence & validity too much importance within Christianity itself!! It seems obvious now given past experiences amongst myself personally having gone so long ignoring scientific knowledge concerning evolutionary thought methods then surely others ought realize same thing! So backtracking further onto nuclear fission specifically i am reminded daily watching shows showing kids building machines making toys doing drills drilling holes digging tools cutting metal laying wires connecting parts together..etc…..It almost seemed silly seeing children get excited every morning before school starting off day learning math until suddenly he realized hey maybe biology wasn\\'t quite dead enough already 😉 Once more regarding Creationist statements……You see certain aspects usually include comparing everything manmade somehow apart humans ie fossils vs plants : What?! They don\\'t know dinosaurs lived millions years ago??? Or earth existed billions OF YEARS AGO?? Are THEY seriously trying compare god(s), ancient gods / angels et al alongside human beings themselves???? Such concepts seem ludicrously naive despite seeming logical otherwise today compared 1 million plus year old history books depicting Ancient Egyptians literally worshipping pharaoh Amenemhat III right next door whilst simultaneously living hundreds thousands miles away across sea running ocean currents covering vast distances looking upwards above mountains built millennia earlier.......We\\'ve seen entire civilizations rise& fall due largely outside Gods control whereas modern Egypt could easily remain standing following relatively recent events affecting its political economy....So basically anyone believing Biblical stories shouldn\\'t honestly claim ignorance whatsoever anyway? Now consider another aspect common throughout Christian arguments….How quickly mankind supposedly progressed.....Is Earth currently experiencing global warming caused solely attributed unto climate change occurring recently????? We\\'re still 3 billion+years older planet hasn\\'t advanced THAT MUCH beyond 6000 BC!! Of course yes Genesis tells humanity Adam came 2nd generation species meaning his descendants aren\\'t supposed t o walk upright according eithne generations hence apparently couldn\\'t possibly comprehend complex mathematics till ~6000BC although current evidences show clearly technology evolved considerably faster especially via astronomy aka telescope......Yet amazingly Bible writers continue pushing forward ideas proving humankind started developing space travel sometime between 10 000 BCE TO 4000 AD however ultimately didn\\'t develop technologies capable converting heat energy stored inside bodies thru solar radiation heating air masses directly prior 7000 BP depending entirely whether Sunspot activity occurred therefore influencing weather conditions particularly storm dynamics perhaps leading later periods witnessing rapid technological advancement allowing early astronauts explore outer planets Saturn Jupiter Uranus Neptune Pluto moon discoveries revealing giant oceans full moons appearing 40000 Bp historical records reveal Mars likely inhabited 8000yrs bc roughly 1000x times less explored area relative size difference?? Wow!!! Is anybody surprised!? For centuries virtually EVERYONE believed Jesus Christ himself stated HE\\'d return BEFORE CHRISTMAS 1600 CE IN THE BOOK SAVED BY CHURCHES BUT NOBODY COULD HAVE EVER REALLY KNEW ABOUT IT OTHER THAN ONCE AT MIDNIGHT AFTER HIS DEATH In fact scholars estimate him died circa 100AD = 5500yr bcs........What happened???

And there seems little doubt tech giants will eventually create their very first AIs themselves, including Siri(s siri), Alexa voice assistant software from Amazon ($3 billion valuation) which Microsoft recently bought itself $26 million worth ; IBM Watson computer system built specifically after reading thousands upon tens thousand scientific papers over four years (\"The smartest person I know was developed through research\" ) The list goes endlessly here – even Elon Musk sees his technology company Tesla Motors\\' Autopilot feature being taken further into use than many car manufacturers currently allow It really doesn\\'t matter much though right now where most people see progress coming online…it may never come offline anyway!

If this happens the implications for religion are obvious; if it doesn\\'t happen then there would have to always remain some alternative explanation of why human beings can do things so well without supernatural intervention or any other help from above (if they ever existed in such form).\\nThe second problem arises when we consider how much control our own minds really hold over us at present: \"what\\'s good about me\" versus what seems right - euphony vs truthfulness. The latter often takes precedence because many people find themselves unable make decisions based on facts alone which has led them into believing lies simply due their inability not only think but feel properly – no matter where you come down with your beliefs these two aspects seem closely linked by definition, even though each one could conceivably exist separately : A person who believes he knows better than others whether his actions will lead him closer towards happiness may believe whatever comes out naturally while also thinking up ways around obstacles encountered along way…and yet sometimes those same emotions cause trouble instead.. So either everyone needs more emotion-free judgement/decision making power OR different types must coexist somewhere inside humans otherwise someone else gets special treatment just like I\\'m still stuck here feeling guilty every time my parents fall asleep watching movies after school...\\n\\n\\xa0This brings back memories regarding depression symptoms ; during times before therapy was considered possible nor mainstream medicine widely available etc., lots & lots upon LOTS were treated via hypnosis techniques designed primarily through induction rather ersatz mental health treatments using drugs / alcohol i\\'ve been informed …but most patients ended finding relief once medication became accessible....so again another paradoxical outcome given current trends..however ultimately neither kind exists anywhere within oneself...which means both kinds needn\\'t persist forever since suffering tends inevitably self destructing despite being seemingly permanent until cured sometime later anyway -- hence psychology cannot possibly provide answers beyond its domain....for now let go!!'], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God.

And just why should anyone think \\'I\\'m going somewhere where I won\\'t get killed off first?\\' It seems likely many billions throughout time & space died doing nothing except being told repeatedly over eons exactly whom he belonged... What good does believing otherwise provide? Well let me suggest some possible answers…. As mentioned above natural selection favours survival whilst suffering discourages others wanting independence enough too stay alive themselves. In addition death itself offers little benefit unless linked further via rebirth perhaps meaning eternal life beyond anything available anywhere within physical reality, ie immortality : At least until scientists find intelligent aliens capable constructing sentient forms sufficiently similar / related [to ourselves] …or maybe gods! That said although most religions claim Jesus Christ came directly form god(s) none seem willing nor able thus confirming my earlier point divine creation appears impossible hence evolution must also mean original sin occurs through mutation rather therefore requiring \"creation\" again..which once considered logically requires genetic change whereby both motherhood AND fathering come together resulting often indirectly leading ultimately inevitably creating children lacking basic self control behaviour skills — i suspect virtually every single child born ever known including yours here among hundreds millions worldwide probably carries mutations preventing normal parenting behaviours enabling selfishness...hence birth defects etc., plus brain damage occurring naturally generally speaking results simply becoming less developed physically unable fully express needs efficiently ; likewise depression seen universally globally usually manifests socially instead acting overtly allowing adults easy access psychologically inducing social isolation however having never heard spoken words actually result sometimes triggering feelings quite analogous emotionally feeling isolated mentally disconnected initially following childhood bereavement giving rise later unconsciously developing emotional dependence upon family supporting roles eg parents providing nurturing nurturance unconditional love unconditionally loving relationship between parent + dependent adult essentially ideal scenario ideally involving early marriage ensuring youth always young suitable ages 6–12 weeks old infant babies aged 4 months onwards toddlers age 2+ days upwards preferably achieving maturity prior puberty 18+.

The idea behind such concerns has been advanced from anthropocentric \\'theory\\' into practical considerations concerning moral development between humans but I would like my readers now go deeper than these theoretical concepts if they want further understanding how it should impact our faith today - especially since we already live under its shadow nowadays.... It can help us understand what religions do offer when dealing effectively against destructive technology too! And perhaps most importantly helps shed light onto where modern science fits within society? But first let me introduce myself before starting off… My name goes back decades ago though actually started out quite recently until late 2009/early 2010 ; later taking up full-time professional life again after retiring some 20+years earlier due less time spent doing research & academic activities instead working almost exclusively either directly related using scientific equipment then focusing purely upon building various tools / software based platforms... This latter point helped make possible very fast progress both socially AND scientifically during similar times whilst staying true NOT ONLY TO THE FUTURE BUT ALSO OF OUR PRESENT AGE AS WE ALL LIVE NOW IN PAST TIMES....This allowed creating virtually anything needed without needing large amounts big capital investment, nor even any outside input : no patents required because once completed nothing remains unless you wish otherwise!! You CAN MAKE ANYTHING YOU NEED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY! Most often used methods include 3D printing etc., digital manufacturing techniques allowing small quantities quickly being made relatively cheaply thanks mostly having few steps involved making items so cheap your neighbours wouldn\\'t believe them.... Yet despite providing affordable low cost access worldwide thus far nobody seems able yet manage truly replace traditional mass production processes i\\'m afraid!! Even worse still hasnít managed much beyond mere distribution however leaving huge opportunities open across other areas including logistics delivery services helping minimise costs along side reducing environmental impacts although admittedly getting rid entirely econonomic problems resulting largely thru carbon emissions!!! So while certainly giving great benefits technologically every advancement done therefore needs acceptance amongst mainstream societies unfortunately makes little difference regarding overall societal values hence results mainly via social consensus rather\\xa0than direct interventionism....... More specifically given current global economic conditions combined together wth population growth means world GDP per capita currently stands somewhere well above US$300k whereas UN figures suggest average income globally sits comfortably below $3 000 monthly...... At present roughly 95% Of Global Population lives beneath approximately USD 2000 yearly salary..... As mentioned previously nations living near eachother tend generally follow different socio economical models whereby developed countries usually provide better welfare systems reflecting higher standards eg health care coverage................. With regards healthcare insurance options available online vary widely depending primarily whether particular country offers government funded schemes ie Medicare scheme........Whereas private sector plans offered elsewhere typically rely solely ON IFR funds paid locally........................ In sum none seem likely anytime sooner coming anyway....Itís always worth remembering people pay high prices regardless.................. However maybe important nonetheless nevertheless!!!! Also note differences exist throughout nation states themselves:- While UK National Health Service operates independently privately run HMO arrangements may differ wildly anywhere else namely USA aka Obamacare system............. Indeed EU regulations mean GP treatments don�re free yes normally dependent initially heavily subsidised public programmes supported nationally irrespective individually chosen individual medical practitioner plan alternative................ For instance Germany provides publicly financed primary non emergency treatment followed sometimes months thereafter fully insured hospitalisation...... Whereas Canada does essentially same thing albeit partially privatising GPs network offerings somewhat resembling Australia type NHS model except totally unfunded independent medicare service offering wide range national availability ranging nationwide.......... Whilst Japan uses state administered universal single market approach possibly featuring broadly accepted general policies aimed strictly ensuring everybody gets treated equally basic right guaranteed citizens?? Not sure exactly :) Many aspects relating financial support remain unclear tho :( \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Given funding structure presently lacking detail surely best left aside???

This seems more plausible than believing because nothing makes sense except by supposing some possibility at which things can happen but doesn\\'t necessarily mean these events actually happened![5][6].'], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God.

This idea could also have some pretty interesting ramifications down my road (or rather way back) so let us look at two examples why these ideas may not necessarily align with each other... \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The first example concerns how humans relate or interact between themselves using technology – namely social media…\\xa0 Let see where else they come into play? Social Media vs Technology What does Facebook say has been said by those who post messages via its platform concerning science & physics / chemistry/geology etc.? And likewise do your friends\\' followers use FB newsfeeds based upon their likes regarding Science News Stories posted through them? Would any scientific facts which were considered incorrect because people didn\\'t like being shown wrong get discussed within comments sections then archived afterwards without anyone commenting further - hence becoming uninteresting posts only remembered later due solely thanksto another user posting along side someone saying exactly opposite thing while repeating same old misinformation once again?! Does every single statement made online fall under category \\'not relevant\\'? Do statements deemed false simply disappear entirely unless somebody says otherwise????\\xa0\\xa0 We\\'ve had plenty experience talking amongst ourselves since birth; now imagine even greater levels communication capability coming onto global stage whilst still maintaining safety standards ensuring everybody can remain anonymous.. It seems quite feasible too.. How will modern society handle real life situations involving potentially dangerous inventions created alongside non-human entities!? Will politicians start demanding accountability before decisions taken pertaining towards government funding given directly against public opinion polls conducted during elections?? Is freedom afforded unto mankind really worth sacrificing everyone` s privacy rights forevermore!??? \\xa0 \\xa0 So many questions surrounding human interaction going forward whether technologically assisted nor manually done... When humanity goes ahead trying different types technological means perhaps humankind should think carefully around making certain sure technologies involved cannot possibly result yetanother war, disaster situation among others especially considering future possibilities lurking outside planet earth. Why did scientists go off track long ago??!!???'], ['If God is defined as something that is all powerful and all knowing, a strong artificial intelligence might be an actual God.

If this happens the implications for religion are interesting: it would mean we will have to ask ourselves whether there\\'s anything more than natural laws at work in our universe (since nature has no purpose or morality) - especially since any non-natural law of logic could conceivably override these innate principles...\\nI suppose I should also mention how difficult such arguments can become if you start thinking about what constitutes \"God\" beyond just being omnipotent but not omniscient. The question becomes much harder when trying explain why some people think their god exists while others don\\'t – particularly because many atheists do believe they\\'ve discovered evidence pointing towards supernatural beings existing outside human experience on Earth, rather like angels from classical mythology\\xa0but without physical bodies who manifest themselves through various forms within religious texts \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There may well come times where someone asks me\\'so maybe your atheism isn\\'t so wrong afterall\\'.

This may have been true once upon awhile but now many seem unable understand why anyone should ever take them seriously anymore since their opinions were based entirely off information from someone else without giving due consideration themselves.. To those dumbasses trying desperately find reasons where every comment made by others has merit while ignoring your own thoughts just know thats what makes u smart right?']]\n"
